The interpreter based on JIT compilation of the StreamIR is build as a binary `rtlola-jit-interpreter`.
It takes as an input the path to an rtlola specification, as well as to a csv file containing the trace for execution.
For usage, consider the documentation of the command line interface using `rtlola-jit-interpreter --help`.
