The compilation of the StreamIR to Rust is provided as a binary `rtlola2rust`.
It takes as input the path to an rtlola specification and an output directory, and produces the source code for the implementation of a monitor for the specification in Rust.
For usage, consider the documentation of the command line interface using `rtlola2rust --help`.
